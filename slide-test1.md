2023 will be a year that will have challenges across the industry and Red Hat will not be immune.  Red Hat is being proactive, this is a good thing!!!

- Hiring Freeze
  * Aim to be flat, will backfill in key areas
  * Exceptions will be case by case
- Expect travel reductions and other cost saving measures 
- Focus on "Performance Management"
  * Goal Setting with Og (tied to OKRs, North Star and Company Objectives)
- We as a team will refocus on delivering Edge/Fleet to where customers are.
